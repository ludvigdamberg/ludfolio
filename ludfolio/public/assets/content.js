    'At WeKnowIt I got my first experience doing a fullstack technical interview that was challenging and a great push to learn and perform under pressure. As a fullstack developer I have been on a website-project utilizing industry standard frameworks like NextJs, tailwind, Stripe, firebase and more. The project group was downsized to a group of two including me who handled the further development under a support contract. ',
    'During this internship, I primarily utilized Angular, TypeScript, and Python to develop a demo application based on one of their products. The demo was built upon an existing product designed to measure productivity on various types of work sites, including construction, excavation, mining, and more. This product is known as Rock2Road. Our demo version leveraged the existing functionality to create a similar application tailored for use in port terminals, and we named it Ship2Port.',
    'LiTHehack is a student-driven organization, hired by Link√∂ping University. Our goal is to help and support the students, by helping them in their programming courses. This is done partly by holding lectures, but also by having a programming workshop two times a week. Through this opportunity I have had the pleasure of helping students in labs that I once did. It is a great way to both learn and teach at the same time. Some of the courses we have helped in include C++, object oriented programming and simple data structures im more advanced courses.  '
